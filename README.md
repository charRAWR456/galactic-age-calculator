### By Jamie Pittak

## Description
This webpage is designed for users to see what their age and life expectancy would be on different planets around the solar system. The application will allow the user to input their birthday and their life expectancy on earth and the application will calculate their age and life expectancy on other planets. this application was built for week eleven "Javascript-Test Driven Development" of Epicodus.

## Setup
1. install Node.js and npm if you do not already have it installed
2. Clone this repository
3. type npm install in your terminal

2. Take two dates (the users birthdate and the current date) and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two.

4. Return the age of the user in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
5. Return the age of the user in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
6. Return the age of the user in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
7. Take in the users life expectancy and Determine how many years a user has left to live on Mercury.
8. Take in the users life expectancy and Determine how many years a user has left to live on Venus.
9. Take in the users life expectancy and Determine how many years a user has left to live on Mars.
10. Take in the users life expectancy and Determine how many years a user has left to live on Jupiter.
